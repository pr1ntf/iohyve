.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiohyve\fP(8) shell script utilizes the FreeBSD hypervisor \fBbhyve\fP(8),
\fBzfs\fP(8), and \fBnmdm\fP(4) to make virtualization on FreeBSD easy and simple.
The basic idea is to store bhyve settings in zfs user properties of zfs
datasets that house important guest files like block devices and grub
configurations. \fBiohyve\fP(8) uses the virtio drivers built into the GENERIC
kernel for virtualization.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fIversion\fP
Prints the current running \fIversion\fP of \fBiohyve\fP
.TP
.B
\fIsetup\fP
Installs required zfs datasets and kernel modules for \fBiohyve\fP.
Usage: '\fBiohyve\fP \fIsetup\fP <\fIpool\fP=poolname> [kmod=0|1] [\fInet=iface\fP]'
where <poolname> is the \fIpool\fP you want to \fIinstall\fP \fBiohyve\fP on,
kmod=<0|1> is if you want \fBiohyve\fP to \fIload\fP or unload the
kernel modules required by \fBiohyve\fP. 1 is \fIload\fP. net=<iface>
will \fIset\fP up the network bridge to the specified interface.
Multiple pools are supported, additional pools \fIget\fP mounted
in /\fBiohyve\fP/poolname
.TP
.B
\fIlist\fP
Lists the name, status for VMM, active bhyve (Running), \fIboot\fP
on \fIstart\fP flag (rcboot), and description for each guest.
.RS
.PP
\fB-l\fP flag pipes the final output to less
.RE
.TP
.B
\fIinfo\fP
Lists properties about the guests and their \fIdisks\fP using flags
to control level of output. Fields include CPU count, RAM, Disk
Size, Pool, OS, Loader, Tap, Console, VMM status, Running status,
rcboot flag, \fIpool\fP, and the description. Use \fB-l\fP to pipe to less.
.RS
.PP
\fB-v\fP is for verbose which adds the fields: OS,
Loader, Tap, and Con.
.PP
\fB-s\fP is for status which \fIadd\fP the fields: VMM,
Running, and rcboot.
.PP
\fB-d\fP is for description. Shows the guest description.
.PP
\fB-l\fP is for less and pipes the final output to less.
.PP
Order of flags is not important. The proper syntax is to use
the flags contiguiously. So "\fB-ld\fP" is the correct way to display
the base output plus description, and then have the output
piped to less.

Sets ZFS properties for guests one at a time
Usage: '\fBiohyve\fP \fIset\fP <name> <property=value> \.\.\.' where
<name> is the name of the guest operating system.
Properties:
ram=512M or ram=2G (M for megabytes, G for gigabtyes)
cpu=1 (number of cpu cores)
con=nmdm0 (where to attach null modem \fIconsole\fP)
tap=tap[n](,tap[n]) (tap device for virtio-net)
[n] is a generic number to specify the tap interface to use
Specify a \fIlist\fP o tap separated by comma for multiple tap
Single tap: \fBiohyve\fP \fIset\fP [name] tap=tap0
Multiple tap : \fBiohyve\fP \fIset\fP [name] tap=tap0,tap1,tap2,tap3

network adapter in the guest OS. \fBiohyve\fP does not check
for a valid MAC address, so double check the property.
pcidev:[n]=<spec>
Generic way to \fIadd\fP devices to the guest.
[n] is a generic random number or string
<spec> defines a virtual device added to the guest
by using a bhyve \fB-s\fP argument without the pcislot
or function argument. PCI slot numbers are assigned
automatically by \fBiohyve\fP.

like to \fIremove\fP from the guest, and <size> is the size
of the virtual block device in '16G' format where the
capital G signifies gigabytes.
See '\fBiohyve\fP \fIdisks\fP' for a \fIlist\fP of \fIdisks\fP for a guest
.TP
.B

.TP
.B
\fIclone\fP
Clone a guest. Note that this will \fIclone\fP all of the properties.
If you want to use the \fIclone\fP and the original guest at the
same time you will need to change the tap and nmdm properties
or use the \fB-r\fP option to have \fBiohyve\fP do this for you
Usage: '\fBiohyve\fP \fIclone\fP [\fB-c\fP | \fB-r\fP] <name> <clonename>' where <name>

ahci-hd emulation to use them. Tarball is put in the guest
dataset ex: /\fBiohyve\fP/guestname/guestname.tar.gz
Usage: '\fBiohyve\fP \fIexport\fP <name>' where <name> is the name of the
guest.
.TP

.TP
.B
\fIconsole\fP
Consoles into a guest operating system. Utilizes \fBnmdm\fP(4) and
\fBcu\fP(1) to open a \fIconsole\fP on a guest operating system. Since
\fBbhyve\fP(8) does not emulate video, so we need to administer
the guests via a serial communication device. Since \fBiohyve\fP
uses \fBcu\fP(1), you will need to press the tilde (~) twice
then period (.) to exit the \fIconsole\fP.
(Think typing ~~. real fast to exit \fIconsole\fP)
If that fails to work, try pressing tilde (~) then press
Control + D (^D). Note that on some machines, you cannot
escape the \fIconsole\fP. See \fIconreset\fP below to escape all consoles.
Usage: '\fBiohyve\fP \fIconsole\fP <name>' where <name> is the name
of the guest operating system.
